function ecgpuwave(varargin)

 ecgpuwave(recordName,annFileName,startTime,stopTime,qrsAnn,pflag,signalList)

    Wrapper to the ECGPUWAVE binary written by Pablo Laguna (laguna@posta.unizar.es), Raimon Jan[�e], Eudald Bogatell, and David Vigo Anglada:
         http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/ecgpuw-1.htm

 ECGPUWAVE analyses an ECG signal from the specified record 'recordName', detecting the QRS complexes
 and locating the beginning, peak, and end of the P, QRS, and ST-T waveforms. The output of ecgpuwave
 is written as a standard WFDB-format annotation file associated
 with the specified annotator 'outputAnnFileName'.

 The QRS detector is based on the algorithm of Pan and Tompkins (reference 1) with some improvements that
 make use of slope information (reference 2). Optionally, QRS annotations can be provided as input (see option 'qrsAnn'),
 permitting the use of external QRS detectors such as sqrs(1) or manually-edited annotations
 (which can be created using wave(1) ). The waveform limit locator is based on the algorithm
 described in reference 3 and evaluated in references 3 and 4.

 The output annotation file contains PWAVE ("p") and TWAVE ("t") annotations
 that indicate the P- and T-wave peaks, as well as QRS annotations (NORMAL ("N") if generated
 by the built-in QRS detector, or copies of the input QRS annotations if these were supplied).
 ECGPUWAVE classifies each T wave as type 0 (normal), 1 (inverted), 2 (positive monophasic),
 3 (negative monophasic), 4 (biphasic negative-positive), or 5 (biphasic positive-negative);
 this numeric classification is written into the num field of each TWAVE annotation.
 The P, QRS, and T waveform onsets and ends are marked in the output annotation file using
 WFON ("(") and WFOFF (")") annotations. The num field of each WFON and WFOFF annotation designates
 the type of waveform with which it is associated: 0 for a P wave, 1 for a QRS complex, or 2 for a T wave.

 WARNING: 
   If ECGPUWAVE is used without providing an annotator file for the R peaks it relies on a Pan-Tompkins detector. 
   This detector may not be optimized for your particular signal, and thus may need to be tuned, yielding anempty annotation
   file. In this case, you may want to first run a QRS detector to generate an appropriate QRS annotation file, 
   which you can then check manually prior to calling ECGPUWAVE with the
   'qrsAnn' option described below.

 IMPORTANT NOTE:
     A patch to the original Fortran source files was provided by Roberto Sassi in
     order to compile ECGPUWAVE in 64-bit arch. This patch requires
     compiling the source code with gfortran (g77 is not supported in gcc 4.x), which can
     yield slighly different results. For more information please see:

 Required Parameters:

 recordName
       String specifying the name of the record to annotate with ECGPUWAVE.

 annFileName
       String specifying the output file name that ECPUWAVE will store its
       output.

 ecgpuwave(recordName,outputAnnFileName,startTime,stopTime,qrsAnn,pflag,signalList)

 Optional Parameters are:

 startTime
      Either WFDB Time String or 1x1 integer specifying the sample number
      specifying the starting location.

 stopTime
      Either WFDB Time String or 1x1 integer specifying the sample number
      specifying the ending location.

 qrsAnn
       A String represengint the QRS annotation file that ECGPUWAVE should
       use (must be in the WFDP PATH or within the current directory).

 pflag
      A boolean (default = 0), if true all beats are processed, if false,
      only normal beats are used.

 signalList
     A Nx1 vector of integers specifying which signals in 'recordName' are
     to be analyzed (default = [0].
